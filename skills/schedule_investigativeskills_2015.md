**Homework due Sunday, April 12, 11:55pm**

*Spreadsheet backgrounding your person*

* Fill in about 10-15 "facts" found about your subject, including their reliabilty and exact source. You can use [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/a/columbia.edu/spreadsheets/d/1bdhogOnOEtV0mU9Yh_FLLx2eIvfnRbVCvS7YPOvDfpg/edit?usp=sharing) as an example -- it's accessible only through your Columbia Google gmail account. You can use Google sheet or Excel -- it doesn't matter to me.

*  Use [this resources handout](../resources/backgrounding.md) to help you determine good sources. The one from Doug Haddix on this list is really good. The one from Jaimi Dowdell is particularly geared at the "deep web".

*  Don't forget to start with the obvious: a targeted search on Nexis and Factiva, using the proximity searches to find only full names and the lede paragraph/length/xtimes delimiters to make sure it's really about that person. You can use [this old handout from Duke](https://github.com/sarahcnyt/stabile/blob/master/skills/resources/backgrounding.md) as a guide to the different search commands I demonstrated in class.

*Reading*
